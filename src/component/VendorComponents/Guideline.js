            <strong className="pt-2 ">Who is a Street Vendor?</strong>
            <p>
              A street vendor is a person vending goods, food items or
              merchandise of everyday use or offering services to the general
              public.
            </p>
            <p>
              Street vendors can vend in a street, lane, sidewalk, footpath,
              pavement, public park or other public or private areas. They can
              only make a temporary structure or conduct their business by
              moving from place to place.
            </p>
            <p>
              Peddlers, squatters, hawkers and other such people are also
              considered street vendors under the law.

              How can a street vendor apply for a Licence in Mumbai?
            </strong>
            <p>
              <em>The Street Vendors Act, 2014</em>&nbsp;has changed the older
              system of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) issuing
              Licences for street vendors. It establishes new authorities called
              Town Vending Committees (TVC) that will provide a ‘Certificate of
              Vending'.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Bombay High Court in 2015 has placed the following
              restriction:&nbsp;
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Only street vendors holding Licences or conducting business
                before 1 May 2014 are allowed to continue their business and
                apply for the Certificate.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you have any proof that you had a street vending stall even
                without a Licence, before 1 May 2014, you can apply for this new
                Certificate.
              </li>
              <li>
                For street vendors who have started their business after 1 May
                2014, Certificates will not be issued till the TVC conducts a
                Survey.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              During the application process, the following documents may be

            <ul>
              <li>Identity proof such as Birth Certificate or Aadhar</li>

              A TVC Survey is conducted to identify eligible street vendors.
              After the TVC conducts the Survey, a database of all the eligible
              street vendors must be maintained. This database shall
              record:&nbsp;
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>The name of the street vendor </li>

            <p>
              The database will help the BMC identify all the eligible street
              vendors. However, delays have occurred in conducting these Surveys
              and the State Government has indicated that they will conduct the

            <p>
              The Licence or Certificate is non-transferable and cannot be sold

            <p>
              The Licence or Certificate cannot be inherited by anyone including
              a family member doing the same job. However, only if Licence fees
              are paid for and a street vendor dies during that time, their
              family members can continue running the stall until the end of
              that payment period.

            <p>
              Yes, the Pathvikreta Yojana Scheme, 2017 in Maharashtra outlines

            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Be a  citizen of India</li>
              <li>A resident of Maharashtra</li>
              <li>Not have any other source of livelihood</li>
              <li>Be 14 years and older</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              However, this Yojana is not binding and is only to be used as a
              guideline.

            </h4>

            <p>
              No. A street vendor can only set up their stall in the location
              mentioned on their Licence, Certificate or Identity Card.
            </p>

            <p>
              For example, there is a restriction on street vending stalls set
              up outside places of worship. While a vendor can set up a stall
              there, they can only sell items used by devotees in these places
              of worship.&nbsp;

            </h4>

            <p>
              If a street vendor has set up their stall in a no-vending
              zone,&nbsp; the BMC may seize their goods and remove them. In case
              of seizure, the street vendors have a right to obtain a copy of
              a&nbsp;
              <em>panchnama.&nbsp;</em>The<em>&nbsp;panchnama&nbsp;</em>will
              list all the items seized by the BMC accompanied by a signature of
              the person conducting the seizure.&nbsp;
            </p>

            <p>
              For a street vendor to reclaim their goods, the BMC can ask them
              to pay a fine or provide an undertaking.&nbsp;
            </p>

            <p>
              Street vendors can also join their local street vendor
              associations as these associations inform them about their rights
              and undertake measures to protect them. For example, the Azad
              Hawkers Union filed a writ petition against the Pathvikreta Yojana
              Scheme, 2017 of Maharashtra as the scheme was arbitrary and
              against the interests of street vendors across the city.&nbsp;

              </strong>
            </h4>

            <p>
              The BMC can evict a street vendor only if the vendor violates any

              large. No eligible street vendor can be evicted otherwise.
            </p>

            <p>
              If the BMC wishes to modify a street vendors zone, they have to
              consult the police commissioner, members of the public and street
              vendors associations before making any decision. In case of
              eviction, a street vendor will be given 30 days' notice.

              </strong>
            </h4>

            <p>
              In case of eviction or any kind of complaint issued against them,
              the vendor can seek a remedy before the appropriate court or
              before a separate Committee established for the same (see&nbsp;

            </p>

            <p>
              For example, if a street vendor is evicted due to road widening or
              any changes to local rules for street vendors, the vendor can take
              the help of a lawyer to file a petition before the Bombay High
              Court.
            </p>

            <p>
              If there is a dispute on the street vendor's eligibility to
              conduct their business or a complaint that they have rented their
              Certificate to a third person, the Committee established will look
              into the dispute.

            <p>
              The central government launched the PMSVANidhi Scheme where all
              eligible street vendors could avail collateral-free and
              low-interest loans for up to Rs. 10,000.
            </p>

            <p>
              Street vendors can directly apply for these loans from the
              PMSAVNidhi online portal or may apply through their nearest Common
              Service Centre as available in rural areas.
            </p>

            <p>
              Any street vendor who has a valid street vendor's Licence or whose
              name has appeared in the TVC's Survey is eligible to avail of a
              loan under this Scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </p>

            <p>
              Alternatively, in the absence of these documents, a street vendor
              may obtain a Letter of Recommendation from Urban Local Bodies or
              TVC's to avail of this loan.&nbsp;
            </p>

                During the second wave of Covid-19 in 2021 what rules and
                policies are being framed for street vendors in Maharashtra?

            </h4>

            <p>
              The State Government has allowed street vendors selling essential
              goods such as fruits, vegetables and cooked food items to continue
              their business under the new lockdown guidelines.&nbsp;
            </p>

            <p>
              However, there cannot be any crowding at the stall and no one can
              eat or drink anything there. Only pick up and home deliveries are
              allowed from the vendors.
            </p>

            <p>
              The State Government has also assured the transfer of Rs. 1,500 to
              all registered street vendors in the State.&nbsp;
